Due to the size limit of Github, we can't put tutorial movies on Github. However, they are available in the provided dropbox link (Putting movies in this folder simply allows users to play the associated movie, using MATLAB player, during the design process.). Also these tutorial movies are also can be seen on YouTube channel.
