# MagicDNA
DNA origami design tool

![MagicDNA interface](demo/AsssemblyTest.gif)


MagicDNA software for designing multi-component DNA origami structure.

This developing software is  called MagicDNA (Multi-component Assembly in a Graphical Interface guided by Computation for DNA origami) and required MATLAB 2017a at least to run. MagicDNA has been packaged as a MATLAB app(MagicDNA_v2.0.mlappinstall) and can be installed with the attached package. 

The user can directly clone this MagicDNA repository through git. Alternatively, it is recommended to download the MATLAB app package (see new freeform version below) (MagicDNA.mlappinstall: https://www.dropbox.com/s/69dvu40b1g59tj5/MagicDNA_v2.0.2_03212020.mlappinstall?dl=0) only and install to MATLAB apps list. Please see MagicDNA_manual.pdf for installation.

MATLAB Run-time version: 

To use MagicDNA without MATLAB, users are required to install MATLAB Run-time from the Mathwork website, according to your operation system. This package was compiled with Run-time v9.2 and users have to use this version (v9.2) of MATLAB-Runtime. Due to the limitation of certain MATLAB functions in Run-time, we removed the instruction movies in the software package but they are still available on the YouTube channel. Please see the user manual for how to setup the environment variables for Linux and Mac.
