MagicDNA software for designing multi-component DNA origami structure.

This developing software is  called MagicDNA (Multi-component Assembly in a Graphical Interface guided by Computation for DNA origami) and required MATLAB 2017a at least to run. MagicDNA has been packaged as a MATLAB app(MagicDNA_v2.0.mlappinstall) and can be installed with the attached package. 

The user can directly clone this MagicDNA repository through git. Alternatively, it is recommended to download the MATLAB app package (MagicDNA_v2.0.mlappinstall: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0xdjlyvdx8ixh9p/MagicDNA_v2.0.mlappinstall?dl=0) only and install to MATLAB apps list. Please see MagicDNA_manual.pdf for installation.
